# Accessbility Maze Game Team 02

## Purpose of the Game
- The purpose of creating this game for individuals with visual impairments is to promote inclusivity and accessibility in the gaming experience â€“ addressing the need for immersive entertainment to foster a sense of independence and enjoyment in interactive digital environments.

## Game Description
- A multi-level maze game (web application) based strictly on auditory cues.
- Unique Features: 
    - All instructions are visible/readable by OS text-to-speech
    - *Settings features:* Font Size, Color Contrast, Change Key-Bindings 
    - Game is designed to be fair for all visually-impaired players
    - Leaderboards for a fun and competitive experience
    - Multi-Leveled - replayability
    - Save progress and pause game option at any given point

## Playing Instructions
- *Controls:* Arrow keys on Keyboard. Users can change it on the settings page. 
- In each level, immerse yourself in the music and locate the hidden object on the screen by relying on the audio cues.
- As you move closer to the target, the music will get louder, and it will decrease as you move away.
- Using Headphones is recommended for the best gaming experience. 

## Levels and Progression

- Levels 0 and 1 are obstacle-free, while subsequent levels introduce preset obstacles on the map.
- No sound indicates hitting a wall or boundary; listen for the 'step' sound to ensure proper movement.
- Upon successfully finding the hidden object, a victory sound effect will play, prompting you to advance to the next level.

## Obstacles 
- The preset levels include walls which prohibit the users from moving forward and deadends that add extra challenge. 
- Users are expected to find another way to reach the object. 

## Leaderboard scoring

- Users are ranked based on the time it took them to finish a particular level.

## Accessibility features/ADA compliance

- Performed user-testing using the keyboard and OS text-to-speech tool
- Project follows HTML semantic guidelines

## Improvements if time permits

- Establishing a database for secure data retrieval.


## Additional Features

- As players advance through increasingly difficult levels, our future plans involve introducing a greater variety of obstacles. One proposed addition is the inclusion of fire hazards within the game. These hazards pose a threat to users, causing their character to be "killed" and resetting their progress for the current level. If a user experiences three or more deaths in a single level, their overall progress will be reduced by two levels. 

- We are keen on integrating voice commands to enhance the game's accessibility by eliminating the need for traditional keyboard inputs. These voice commands could be utilized to communicate game instructions and assist users in navigating through different levels, while also giving them a chance to speak what moves they want to make. This will also make loggin into the accounts easier for users without keyboard. 

- To enhance the game's excitement, we aim to explore the possibility of randomizing key elements such as the target location, user starting position, and the placement of obstacles on the map.
